# versus.space

live tug-of-war for opinions. create a poll with two options, drop a link, and watch people vote in real time. bars grow and shrink with speedometer vibes, floating numbers, and the occasional crown for the leader.

## what it's for

- icebreakers, all-hands, quick debates, "this vs that" showdowns
- seeing momentum, not just totals—rate and streaks keep it exciting
- lightweight: one link, no installs

## how it works

- sign up with email and password
- create a poll, share the URL
- each click adds a point. shows rate (pts/sec), total points, playful streak effects
- wider bar wins; animated gauges show the battle
- for presenters: mirror on a big screen, let audience tap on their devices

## running locally

**requirements:** Node 18+, npm
